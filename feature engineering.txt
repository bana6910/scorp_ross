Cleaning?
- can we combine any features? like assortment types, store type?
	- check sales diff. - if not significant then combine

- Any weird values? - clean by mean, mod, etc..

- Broad categories? - wrong naming can be combined? like >>>> low Fat = LF, Regular = reg

- CompetitionDistance NA's are only 2516; although CompetitionOpenSince NA's are 276100; so there are lot of missing values.

- No need to worry about 433719 NA's in Promo2Since, as Promo2 =0 is exactly for 433719 records, meaning for these records, promosince data is not available which is rightly should not be available

- State Holiday a = public holiday; all schools are closed on public holidays

combining year mon in- competitionsince, promosince
as.numeric(as.POSIXct("2015-10-01", format = "%Y-%m-%d") - store$Promo2Since)
